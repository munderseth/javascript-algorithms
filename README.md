# JavaScript Algorithms [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lucasfcosta/javascript-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lucasfcosta/javascript-algorithms) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lucasfcosta/javascript-algorithms/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lucasfcosta/javascript-algorithms?branch=master)

A collection of JavaScript algorithms implementations and explanations on them.


# Structure of this repository

This repository is organized in the following way:
* `utils` - Contains utility functions and data samples for us to work on
* `test` - Contains tests and possibly benchmarks for the algorithms
* `algorithms` - Contains a folder for each one of the implemented algorithms
    * <algorithm_name> - Contains a README.md file with an explanation on the algorithm and its implementation


# Contributing
